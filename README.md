# Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life implemented in C.

The basic rules are:

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

This was originally a task for a coursework but i have rewritten the code with extra functionality.

Extra functionality added:
- Saving and loading settings
- Listing current settings
